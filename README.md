<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<em>Un curso de Álgebra Lineal II</em> is an introduction to advanced linear algebra written in Spanish. This book is based on my lecture notes for a second course in linear algebra taught at <a href="http://math.uniandes.edu.co">de Los Andes University</a>. The book has been written for math and physics majors, but it can be read by anyone with good foundations in linear algebra.

The exposition, although mathematically rigorous, approaches the subject from a computational perspective and it could be broadly seen as covering three main topics:

<ol>
  <li>Jordan-Chevalley decomposition</li>
  <li>The spectral theorem</li>
  <li>Multilinear algebra</li>
</ol>

The book starts recalling the basic elements of linear algebra: vector spaces, bases, dimension, linear transformations, coordinates and matrices, projections and direct sums.

The exposition on the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition is subdivided in three parts: the decomposition of a space into direct sum of invariant subspaces, nilpotent operators and the Jordan form. This is all covered in Chapter 2. The decomposition is carried out through the Bézout identity on the coprime factors of the characteristic polynomial, so the book has an appendix covering some basic results on the algebra of polynomials on one variable.

To get to the spectral theorem we first cover dual spaces (Chapter 3) and then move to inner product spaces. The subjects of Euclidean spaces (Chapter 4) and Hermitian spaces (Chapter 6) are covered separetly. In particular, we stress that a Hermitian space is basically a Euclidean space with a complex structure and a symplectic bilinear form (Chapter 7).

The final chapter deals with multilinear algebra. We drop the universal property of the tensor product to focus on how to work with tensors.
